## AML Class Projects
This repository contains all projects and assignments completed for my Applied Machine Learning (AML) course. Each project focuses on practical applications of data cleaning, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation using real-world datasets.

### Project 1: From Dirty Data to Predictive Models
In this project, I worked with the UCI Heart Disease dataset to build predictive models for diagnosing heart disease. The workflow included:
* Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing inconsistencies, and addressing outliers.
* Feature Engineering: Log transformations, derived features (e.g., cholesterol-to-age ratio, thalassemia indicators), scaling, and one-hot encoding.
* Model Training: Implemented Gaussian Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, Ridge, and LASSO.
* Model Evaluation: Compared models using accuracy, precision/recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.
The best performance was achieved with Gaussian Naive Bayes (Î±=0.01), reaching ~87% accuracy and strong recall, making it particularly well-suited for reducing false negatives in a medical diagnosis context
